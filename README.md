# boot-uberjar-example [![Build Status][badge]][build]

This example project demonstrates how to package a Clojure application
as a jar that can be executed with `java -jar`, using the [Boot] build tool.

You can also run the project's `-main` method without creating an uberjar with:

    ./build.boot
